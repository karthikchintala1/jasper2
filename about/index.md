I am a software developer working on Microsoft.Net platform in an organization in India. I'm a JavaScript/JQuery enthusiast. In my spare time, I write blog posts and work on some private projects. Mostly I love to be a C# guy but as the role in my company demands to work on both UI and API.

### About this Blog
This blog is all about programming and may be sometimes any miscellaneous stuff. I'll not be publishing post's on every keyword in C#. The posts in this blog will be intermediate and sometimes advanced stuff that some people out there might not be able to understand.

Most of the stuff in this blog is inspired by real world problems that cause in day to day life of a developer. So, it might be random.
