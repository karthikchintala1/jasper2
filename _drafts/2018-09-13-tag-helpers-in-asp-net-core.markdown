In this post, we'll see how to use the tag helpers inside razor files in ASP.NET Core application.

### What are Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core?

Unlike normal [HTML Helpers in MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/views/creating-custom-html-helpers-cs), the Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core allow us to have server side code to customize the HTML elements in razor files.

### Why use Tag Helpers?
- Enables HTML friendly development experience
- Provides intellisense for using server side properties
